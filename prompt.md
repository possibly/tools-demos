You are helping me create an interactive 
educational demo webpage as an Artifact. The 
webpage should include two main features: ‚∏ª 
1. Button with Wave Interference/Diffraction 
Effect
   ‚Ä¢ Place a button in the middle of the page 
   labeled ‚ÄúClick Me‚Äù. ‚Ä¢ When clicked, it 
   should animate a quick wave 
   interference/diffraction effect as visual 
   feedback (like ripples of water or 
   overlapping sine waves spreading outward). 
   ‚Ä¢ Keep it lightweight and visually 
   appealing (SVG, Canvas, or CSS animations 
   acceptable). ‚Ä¢ The effect should disappear 
   smoothly within ~1 second, so it feels 
   like responsive feedback.
‚∏ª 1. Animated Chart for Explaining Math ‚Ä¢ 
   Below the button, include a section with 
   an SVG or Canvas chart that animates 
   mathematical concepts step by step, 
   similar to the refraction demo on 
   kube.io/blog/liquid-glass-css-svg. ‚Ä¢ Use 
   wave interference as the topic: ‚Ä¢ Show two 
   sine waves combining. ‚Ä¢ Animate their 
   superposition step by step (first wave 
   alone, second wave alone, then both 
   together). ‚Ä¢ Provide a simple visual 
   slider or play button to step through the 
   states. ‚Ä¢ Animate smoothly between states 
   (e.g., Framer Motion, GSAP, or 
   requestAnimationFrame). ‚Ä¢ Keep the chart 
   annotated with short labels like: ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúWave 
   1: sin(kx)‚Äù ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúWave 2: sin(kx + œÜ)‚Äù ‚Ä¢ 
   ‚ÄúResult: Superposition‚Äù
‚∏ª General Requirements ‚Ä¢ The final Artifact 
should be a single HTML file with embedded 
JavaScript and CSS. ‚Ä¢ Use clean, modern web 
development practices (React optional, but 
plain HTML/JS fine). ‚Ä¢ Prioritize clarity and 
smooth animation, not heavy frameworks. ‚Ä¢ 
Include enough inline comments in the code so 
I can understand how it works and extend it 
later. ‚∏ª
üí° Output the complete HTML/JS/CSS code for the demo, so I can run it directly in a browser.
