<h2>About StoryLang</h2>

<p>StoryLang ideally helps users generate and share AI-generated stories that are about topics that interest them at the appropriate CEFR level in the language they are trying to learn. To facilitate listening and reading comprehension, it also generates fairly high quality AI audio clips of those stories and AI reading comprehension questions. This hopefully supports learning a language by extensive reading, which suggests that reading/listening to engaging material that you can understand 95%-ish of will naturally lead to a deeper understanding of the language. Oh, and it's entirely free, as in 0 cost to myself or end users and as in open source, thanks to Google Gemini Canvas.</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>You sign in with your Google account, enter a topic you want a story about, and Gemini generates the story for you using your free credits.</p>

<p>Users will then see that their story is split into sections: snippets of the story (like the first 3 sentences) and a reading comprehension quiz about that section. Users can also listen to Gemini read them that story section in their target language by clicking the headphones icon in that section.</p>

<p>Lastly, thanks to Google's free integration of Firebase in Gemini Canvas, the app supports sharing your stories with others. Alternatively, you can just save your story for your own personal use later. Or, not save your story at all.</p>

<h2>How I use it</h2>
<p>I have been traveling around Mexico City for the first time and my inability to connect with the amazing people here frustrated me. This app has helped me turn my fantasies of engagement with the people around me into stories that I can use to improve my Spanish. Stories about talking with the friendly cafe owner or taking a Spanish-language tour of the pyramids in Teotihuac√°n are emotionally meaningful to me right now, and setting the target CEFR level to A2 allows me to more effortlessly enjoy learning through repeated usage of vocab and grammatical constructions.</p>

<p>I find the story quality to be ok enough since I am choosing meaningful topics. I have found that you can greatly steer the AI to produce all sorts of stories (focus on dialogue, a unique situation, an interesting cast of characters, paste in a news article, use your favorite pre-existing characters, etc). Perhaps there are some really great stories for you and your language level if you can find the right prompts.</p>
